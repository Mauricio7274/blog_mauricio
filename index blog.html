        <h2>what is a nft?</h2>
        <p><span>NFTs work through blockchain technology, which works through a decentralized computer network, with blocks or nodes linked and secured using cryptography. and they are assigned a kind of digital certificate of authenticity, a series of metadata that cannot be modified. In these metadata its authenticity is guaranteed, the starting value and all the acquisitions or transactions that have been made are recorded, as well as its author. </p>

        <h2>What will they offer to gaming?</h2>
        <p><span>what they say it will be able to offer is that thanks to the block chain certificate, you could visually differentiate 2 identical virtual objects, and know who owns them, in addition to being able to sell these unique objects that in theory can be obtained by playing, and with the promise that an item obtained can be used in other different games </p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="left">
        <h2>
          the current reality</h2>
        <p><span>the promise that the obtained items can be used in different games is not very credible, because since not many games will have compatible gameplay, for example having an assault rifle in a medieval war game, they would need too many servers with the information of each possible existing item and it would make a balanced game almost impossible, obtaining an advantage for those with great economic power, in addition to the current ntf games that can be played, in addition to having little or no playability for the most part, handle excessive prices for the most part even exceeding the thousand dollars per item, with the option of being able to borrow an item in exchange for only getting a small part of what was earned, taking almost all of the profits to the original owner, these few profits being only useful in countries with a very low salary, Also, because the currency of the game is for speculation and they need input from new players regularly, a currency that could be worth more than 10 dollars each, a month is worth almost nothing, generating the closure of the game</p>
